The script for Customer Satisfaction Analysis output the following:

Customer_rating  ...  Customer_care_calls
Customer_rating             1.000000  ...             0.012209
Cost_of_the_Product         0.009270  ...             0.323182
Discount_offered           -0.003124  ...            -0.130750
Customer_care_calls         0.012209  ...             1.000000

Based on the correlation matrix, here are some interpretations:

1. Customer Rating vs. Cost of the Product:
   - Correlation: 0.009270
   - This indicates a very weak positive relationship between the customer rating and the cost of the product. Essentially, there's almost no linear relationship between how much a product costs and how it's rated by customers.

2. Customer Rating vs. Discount Offered:
   - Correlation: -0.003124
   - This suggests a negligible negative correlation between the customer rating and the discount offered. It implies that the amount of discount offered on a product has little to no impact on how customers rate their experience.

3. Customer Rating vs. Customer Care Calls:
   - Correlation: 0.012209
   - This shows a very weak positive correlation between the number of customer care calls and customer ratings. It could be interpreted as a slight tendency for higher customer ratings with an increased number of calls, but this relationship is not strong.

From these correlations, it's clear that these variables have very weak relationships with customer ratings. 
This suggests that factors like the cost of the product, the discounts offered, and the number of customer care calls don't 
significantly influence how customers rate their experience, at least not in a linear manner.

Since the correlations are very weak, it might be interesting to explore these relationships further with more 
advanced analytical techniques or look into other factors that could have a stronger impact on customer satisfaction. 

Next, data visualization aspect is analyzed to see if there are any non-linear relationships or patterns that the 
correlation analysis might have missed. You can create scatter plots for these variables 
against `Customer_rating` to visually inspect any potential trends or unique patterns.

See figure named Scatter-plot.png 

The above figure is scatter plot matrix which we conclude the following:

1. Customer Rating vs. Cost of the Product:
   - The scatter plots do not seem to show any clear trend or pattern between customer ratings and the cost of the product. 
     This is consistent with the low correlation we saw earlier.

2. Customer Rating vs. Discount Offered:
   - Similarly, there is no apparent trend between the customer rating and the discounts offered. 
     The points are widely scattered, indicating that customers rate their experience without a strong bias towards the discount they received.

3. Customer Rating vs. Customer Care Calls:
   - The distribution of points here also looks quite random without a discernible pattern. 
     There might be a slight concentration of data points at certain levels of customer care calls, but there is no clear indication 
     that more calls lead to higher or lower ratings.

From these visualizations, it seems that customer ratings are not strongly influenced by the cost of the product, the discount offered, 
or the number of customer care calls. This suggests that other factors not included in these plots might play a more significant role 
in determining customer satisfaction.
