The script for Cost and Discount Strategy output the following:

1. Relationship Between Cost of Product and Discount Offered:
   The scatter plot (cf. 5-relation-between-cost-of-product-and-discount-offered.png) does not depict a clear linear relationship between the cost of the product and the discount offered. The discounts seem to be spread across various cost ranges without a distinct pattern. This indicates that the discount strategy might not be directly proportional to the product's cost.

2. Correlation between Discount Offered and Customer Satisfaction:
   - Correlation: -0.003124443913313975
   - This very weak negative correlation suggests that the discount offered has virtually no linear influence on custome satisfaction. In other words, offering more or less discount doesn't seem to significantly affect how customers rate their experience.

3. Correlation between Discount Offered and Delivery Timeliness:
   - Correlation: 0.3971084735832174
   - This moderate positive correlation indicates that there is a relationship between the discounts offered and delivery timeliness.A higher discount might be associated with a higher likelihood of not delivering on time. This could imply that products with discounts are possibly more popular and thus more prone to supply or delivery chain delays, or it could suggest operational issues when handling discounted sales.

The insights here could have several implications for the company's pricing and discounting strategies. 
The lack of a clear correlation between discounts and customer satisfaction might indicate that customers value factors other than 
discounts more highly when rating their satisfaction. The positive correlation between discounts and delivery delays could suggest 
a need to review the company's logistics and delivery processes, particularly for discounted items, to ensure that promotions 
do not adversely affect delivery performance.

These findings can be an excellent starting point for the company to refine their discounting strategy and possibly focus on improving
delivery efficiency, especially for products that are on promotion.
