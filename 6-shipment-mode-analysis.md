The script for Shipment Mode Analysis output the following bar plots (cf. 6-shipment-mode-analysis.png) :

1. Customer Satisfaction by Shipment Mode:
   Customer satisfaction ratings appear to be uniform across all shipment modes. This indicates that customers' satisfaction may not be significantly affected by whether the product is shipped by flight, road, or ship.

2. Delivery Performance by Shipment Mode:
   The on-time delivery rates for different shipment modes are also similar. It seems that the mode of shipment does not drastically affect the likelihood of on-time delivery in this dataset.

3. Cost and Discount by Shipment Mode:
   - The cost of products shipped by different modes is roughly the same, suggesting a standardized pricing strategy regardless of theshipment method.
   - However, the average discount offered varies slightly among the shipment modes. This could indicate a strategic decision to offermore discounts on certain shipment methods, perhaps to balance out longer shipping times or other inconveniences.

These insights suggest that the company has managed to maintain a consistent level of customer satisfaction and delivery performance 
across different shipment modes, which is an excellent operational achievement. The variation in discounts might be a tactical move to
manage customer expectations and demand across different shipping options.

The company could use this information to ensure that their shipping operations continue to meet customer expectations effectively. 
Additionally, they might want to investigate the reasons behind the slight differences in discounting to refine their pricing 
strategies further.
