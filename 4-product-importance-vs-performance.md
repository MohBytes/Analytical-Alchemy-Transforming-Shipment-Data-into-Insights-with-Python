The script for Product Importance vs. Performance output the following bar plot (cf. 4-product-importance-vs-performance.png):

1. Customer Satisfaction by Product Importance:
   The average customer rating is approximately the same across products of different importance levels (high, low, medium). This suggests that product importance, as classified by the company, may not significantly impact how customers rate their satisfaction.

2. Delivery Performance by Product Importance:
   The average on-time delivery rate does not seem to vary significantly with the importance level of the product. All three importance categories show similar on-time delivery performance.

3. Calls and Discounts by Product Importance:
   - Products of high importance appear to receive more customer care calls than those of medium and low importance, which could indicate a higher level of engagement or need for support for these products.
   - Interestingly, high-importance products also tend to have higher discounts offered compared to products of medium and low importance. This may reflect a strategic decision by the company to incentivize the purchase of high-importance products or to compensate for potential issues such as longer delivery times or other factors.

From these findings, it seems that the company's classification of product importance does not correlate strongly with customer 
satisfaction or delivery performance, but it does affect the level of customer service interaction and the discount strategy. 
This could be a strategic choice or might point to areas where customer expectations for high-importance products are not being met 
as anticipated.

These insights could be valuable for the company to evaluate whether their current strategies align with customer expectations 
and delivery outcomes, and if there is a need to adjust their approach to product importance classification, customer service, 
and discounting policies.
