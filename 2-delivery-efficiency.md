The script for Delivery Efficiency output the following:

1. Correlation between Weight and Delivery Timeliness:
   - Correlation: -0.26879258393879907
   - There is a moderate negative correlation between the weight of the product and its on-time delivery status. This suggests that heavier products are less likely to be delivered on time. This could be due to the logistics challenges associated with moving heavier items.

2. On-time Delivery Rates by Mode of Shipment:
   The bar plot (cf. 2-on-time-delivery-dates-by-mode-of-shipment.png) shows the on-time delivery rates for each mode of shipment.It appears that there's a variation in on-time delivery rates between different shipment modes. One mode may have a higher percentage of late deliveries (indicated by the orange segment).

3. On-time Delivery Rates by Warehouse Block:
   The bar plot (cf. 2-on-time-delivery-dates-by-warehouse-block.png) for warehouse blocks illustrates the on-time delivery rates for each block. Similar to the shipment modes, there may be differences in delivery efficiency between warehouse blocks.

The negative correlation between weight and on-time delivery could point to the need for improved handling and transportation 
strategies for heavier products. The variation in on-time delivery rates by shipment mode and warehouse block can guide the company 
to investigate specific issues related to certain shipment methods or warehouse operations.

These insights can help the company to identify where they can make process improvements or invest in additional resources to enhance 
delivery performance, especially for heavier items and in warehouse blocks or shipment modes that show lower on-time delivery rates.
