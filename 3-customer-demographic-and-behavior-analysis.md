The script for Customer Demographics and Behavior Analysis output the following bar plots :

1. Customer Loyalty Analysis:
   - The bar plot (cf. 3-customer-loyalty-analysis.png) indicates that repeat customers (those with prior purchases) have a higher average rating, which could suggest that repeat customers are more satisfied.
   - However, the bar for on-time delivery rate (`Reached.on.Time_Y.N`) is lower for repeat customers, which suggests that repeat customers might experience more delays than new customers.

2. Gender Analysis on Purchasing Habits and Satisfaction:
   - The plot (cf. 3-gender-analysis-on-purchasing-habits-and-satisfaction.png) shows the average values for cost of the product,discount offered, prior purchases, and customer rating by gender.
   - It appears that there are no significant differences in the average cost of products purchased by different genders.
   - The discounts offered and prior purchases are relatively similar across genders, which could indicate that there is no significant gender-based difference in these areas.
   - Customer ratings by gender are also quite similar, suggesting that satisfaction levels are relatively uniform across genders.

These results imply that while customer satisfaction does not vary much between genders, repeat customers seem to be more satisfied 
even though they experience more delivery delays. This could indicate a loyalty factor where repeat customers are more tolerant of 
certain issues, or it could suggest that the factors driving satisfaction are different for new versus repeat customers.

The company could use these insights to tailor their customer engagement and loyalty programs, perhaps by improving delivery 
performance for repeat customers or by identifying and amplifying the factors that drive their higher satisfaction ratings.
